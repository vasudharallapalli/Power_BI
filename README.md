# Power BI WoW 2025 - Week 9 Challenge  

In this week's **Power BI WoW challenge**, we transform a **stacked bar chart** into a **bullet chart** to improve clarity and comparability.  

This enhanced visualization allows for a more intuitive analysis of **sales trends**, highlighting both growth and decline across different territories. The **Month-over-Month percentage (MoM%)**, represented as error bars, provides a clear view of **monthly performance shifts**.  

Compared to a standard **stacked bar chart**, the bullet chart makes it easier to **identify trends, detect performance gaps, and compare sales fluctuations over time**. This approach ensures that insights are **more actionable and visually distinct**.
